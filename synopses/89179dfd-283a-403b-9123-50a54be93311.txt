BEGINNING: It is the spring of 1840 and France is a country on the brink of change. The monarchy is crumbling and the people are hungry for revolution. Against this backdrop, a young woman named Elise de Laurent finds herself torn between two very different men. On one side is her fiance, Henri d'Astier, a wealthy nobleman who is everything a young woman could want: handsome, charming, and ambitious. On the other side is Elise's childhood friend, Jean-Paul Marat, a radical philosopher who is passionate about the causes of the people and is galvanizing the masses with his stirring speeches. As the political situation in France deteriorates, Elise finds herself increasingly drawn to Jean-Paul's ideals and his vision for a better future. She begins to question her own privileged role in society and whether she truly belongs with Henri. As the country hurtles towards revolution, Elise must make a choice: between the man she loves and the man she believes in. MIDDLE: The summer of 1789 is a time of great upheaval in France as the people take to the streets to demand change. Elise finds herself caught up in the excitement and joins Jean-Paul on the front lines of the protest. She is ecstatic when the Bastille is finally stormed and the monarchy toppled. However, the euphoria is short-lived as the new republic quickly descends into chaos. Jean-Paul becomes one of the most vocal leaders of the radical Jacobin party, calling for more drastic measures to be taken against the enemies of the state. Elise begins to have doubts about the direction the revolution is taking and whether the Violence is truly justified. As the country is plunged into turmoil, Elise must decide which side she is on: the man she loves or the cause she believes in.
