Plan the NEXT CHAPTER into eight (8) SCENES. Describe each SCENE with one or two sentences.

STORY UP TO THIS POINT: A human crew helps an alien planet win a war against another tribe, but their captain is captured and taken prisoner. The crew rescues the captain before he can be tortured, but he is suffering from hallucinations caused by exposure to an alien plant. They find an alien spaceship and fly back to their own ship. The captain is able to see through the eyes of the aliens and realizes his crewmates are being attacked. He screams for them to run, but they are all killed. The aliens are killed when their ship explodes before they can remove Wilder's second eye. The captain sees all the different paths his life could have taken and all the different ways his ship and crew could have died. He is transported to a strange place with no memory of how he got there. A giant creature tells him it is time for him to die and asks if it should kill everyone on board Wilder's ship except for Wilder who would then be allowed one last request before being killed?
