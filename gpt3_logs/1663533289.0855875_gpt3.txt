==========

In Scandinavia, in the 15th century, a young woman named Astrid is determined to become a warrior, despite the fact that women are not typically allowed to train for combat. She disguises herself as a man and joins the ranks of a group of Vikings preparing to go on a raiding expedition. Astrid quickly proves herself to be a skilled fighter and is soon accepted as one of the group. However, she is also attracted to one of her fellow warriors, a woman named Freydis. She is unsure whether to pursue a relationship with Freydis or keep her feelings hidden, but decides to take a chance and confesses her love. Freydis is initially hesitant, but after some discussion, the two women decide to give a relationship a try. However, they keep their relationship a secret from the rest of the group, knowing that it would not be accepted. As the raiders approach their target, a castle belonging to a rival clan, they are ambushed. Astrid and Freydis fight bravely, but are outnumbered and soon captured. MIDDLE: The rival clan's leader, a woman named Sigrid, decides to spare their lives and instead makes them her prisoners. She is curious about their relationship and interrogates them about it. Astrid and Freydis are initially resistant, but Sigrid is relentless and eventually breaks them down. They tell her about their love for each other and how they have to keep it a secret. Sigrid is intrigued by their story and decides to help them. She hatches a plan for them to escape and even provides them with weapons. When the time comes, Astrid and Freydis make their escape and fight their way back to their own clan. They are reunited with their fellow warriors and are hailed as heroes. END: Astrid and Freydis live happily ever after and are able to openly express their love for each other. Their story is told and retold around the campfires and becomes legend.
