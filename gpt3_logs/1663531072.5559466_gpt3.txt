BEGINNING:

==========

In the 5th century in Sub-Saharan Africa, a young man named Ebo is born into a life of privilege as the son of a wealthy chief. As he grows up, Ebo slowly realizes that he does not fit into the mold of what is expected of him as a future chief. He is more interested in exploring his creative side, and he finds himself attracted to other boys instead of girls. At the same time, Ebo is also aware of the unrest brewing in his country as raids by neighboring tribes become more frequent. MIDDLE: As Ebo comes of age, he confides in his best friend, Kefentse, about his feelings and together they explore their sexuality. However, when Ebo's father arranges for him to marry a woman from a neighboring tribe, he knows he can't go through with it. He tells Kefentse that he is going to run away and asks him to come with him. Although Kefentse is hesitant at first, he eventually agrees and the two of them set out into the wilderness. They are constantly on the run from Ebo's father's Warriors, as well as from the raiding parties of other tribes. Despite the danger, they find solace in each other's arms and their love for each other continues to grow. Eventually, Ebo and Kefentse find themselves at the edge of an impassable river. They realize that they can either continue running and risk being caught or killed, or they can settle down and build a life together in this new land. They decide to build a hut by the river and promise to never leave each other's side again. END: Ebo and Kefentse live happily together for many years, raising a family and farming the land. Although they are always on the lookout for raiders, they have found a peace and happiness in each other that they never thought possible. As they old, they sit by the river and reflect on their life together, knowing that they made the right choice all those years ago to build a life together in this new land.
