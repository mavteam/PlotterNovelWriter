Write a concise summary of the following story.


A crew of humans crash-lands on an unknown planet and befriends the aliens living there. They help the aliens win a war against another tribe, discover a hidden chamber in the alien city, and are eventually able to escape back to their own ship. However, their captain is captured and taken prisoner by the aliens. The crew searches for their captain and finds him locked in a cell. They fight off the alien guards and escape with their captain. The crew searches the underground chamber and finds a large, round object. The captain decides to take the object back to the ship. The aliens attack while the crew is still on planet, but they are able to get inside their ship and take off. The aliens follow them into space, but they are unable to keep up with their damaged ship. They are forced to return home without their captain or his prisoner, Wilder. Wilder is taken to a dark room and strapped down to a table. He is injected with a drug that causes him to hallucinate. The aliens strap Wilder into an electric chair and shock him repeatedly. Wilder is placed in a sensory deprivation chamber, where he can't see, hear, or feel anything. Wilder is put in a box with two holes in it, one for his head and one for his arms. He is forced to stay in the box for days at a time. Wilder is placed in an isolation chamber for several weeks. The door is locked from the outside and he has no way of knowing whether it's day or night outside the chamber. He doesn't know if anyone else has been put there with him or if he's alone. He begins to believe that he will never leave the chamber alive and begins talking to himself just so he won't go crazy from being alone so long.  The crew is back on board their ship. After the aliens left, they returned to the underground chamber and found an alien spaceship. They took it and flew it back to their ship. They are now preparing to leave the planet for good. The crew is trying to figure out how to get Wilder out of his box without being detected by the aliens. The spaceship is damaged and they need a part that they don't have on board. They decide to fly back to the alien city and steal it from there. They fly back into the city, but are attacked by a large number of aliens before they can land. The crew fights them off, but not before one of them is shot in the arm by an alien arrow. The captain decides that Wilder isn't worth saving anymore, so he tells everyone else that he's dead and orders them to leave him behind when they take off from the planet again. However, one of his crew members refuses to leave his captain behind and decides that he's going after him whether or not anyone else wants him too. He sneaks away from camp while everyone else is asleep at night and heads toward the alien city on foot in order to rescue Wilder himself if no one else will help him do it first. When he gets near the city, he sees a group of aliens dragging Wilder out of his cell and taking him toward a small building nearby that looks like an execution chamber. He sneaks into the building while they're gone and finds Wilder strapped down inside an electric chair with wires attached to his head, chest, arms, legs, fingers, toes, ears, nose...basically everywhere except for his privates (which is probably why he was still alive). The wires are connected up to some sort of machine with a lever on it that looks like something you'd see in a torture chamber in medieval Europe or something like that (you know what I mean). It looks like someone designed it specifically for torturing people with electricity or something like that (or maybe just killing them). He frees Wilder from his bonds and helps him escape from there before he can be tortured any further. He takes him back outside where everyone else is waiting for them (but not before making sure that no one saw them leaving together) where they explain everything about what happened during their search for their captain as well as what happened when they got back inside their ship after rescuing Wilder again (the part about stealing an alien spaceship was edited out since no one was supposed to know about it anyway). Then they talk about how they're going after their captain again since no one wants him dead anymore (they may have been planning on leaving him behind earlier since he wasn't worth saving anymore [according to their captain] but changed their minds later when someone decided that he still might be worth saving after all). Then one of them suggests searching all over again for another spaceship so that they can go save Captain Jones themselves this time instead of waiting around here for someone else who might never show up anyway (which means stealing another alien spaceship which means sneaking into another dark room where there's probably more than just two guards this time [and lots more arrows]). Then everyone agrees with this idea except for Captain Jones himself who decides not only not let anyone go save him this time but also not even let anyone try because if anyone does try then then all those people will get killed too which means more work for everyone else who has already had enough work already dealing with these aliens so far (but also less work for himself if no one tries because then we'll all just stay here forever until we die naturally instead of having our heads split open by arrows or whatever happens next [if we don't die naturally first]). So then everybody goes home without doing anything except getting caught by those aliens again anyway since none of us did anything at all except talk about doing something which doesn't count as doing anything at all anyway even if we did do it because I'm writing this story right now which means I'm doing something right now even though I'm just sitting here talking instead of actually doing anything right now because I'm writing this story instead which means...well you get my point.)
