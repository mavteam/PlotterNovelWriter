BEGINNING:

==========

It is the year 3rd century BCE and the setting is France. The story opens with a group of men and women gathered around a fire in the middle of a cold winter night. One of the men, a blacksmith named Pierre, is telling a story about a creature known as the Beast of Gevaudan. The Beast is said to be a giant wolf-like creature that has been terrorizing the countryside, killing both people and animals. The blacksmith's story is interrupted by a scream from outside the circle of light cast by the fire. Everyone runs outside to see a woman being dragged away by the Beast. The group gives chase but is unable to catch up to the creature. MIDDLE: The queen of France, Anne, is shown to be very interested in the Beast and what it represents. She sends her own personal physician, Dr. Claude, to study the creature. Claude is unable to find anything physically wrong with the Beast and concludes that it must be possessed by some sort of demon. The queen orders a group of hunters to kill the Beast but they are unsuccessful. The Beast continues to kill both people and animals, leading to a atmosphere of terror and paranoia throughout the country. END: The queen's daughter, Marie, is out riding one day when she is attacked by the Beast. Marie is able to fight off the creature and kill it with her spear. With the Beast dead, the fear and paranoia that had gripped the country begins to dissipate. The story ends with Marie being crowned the new queen of France.
