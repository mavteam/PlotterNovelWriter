As you can see, the outline is a mind map of the entire story. It doesn’t contain any details of the story; it simply plots the next chapter or scene.

It is important to remember that this outline is only a guide for the story; it is not an ending. It is a way for you to plan the entire story before writing it. This will save you from having to rewrite it.

Remember, the outline is your story, not the characters. This means that you have complete control over it. The characters will only act according to your instructions. It is okay if the story goes in a different direction, as long as it is based on the outline.

Once you have this outline, you can go back and fill in the details of each scene or chapter. When you do this, remember to write the outline first. Do not write the first draft and then go back and fill in the outline.

Outlining and writing are like the left and right sides of the brain. You have to use both sides. If you only use the right side of your brain, you will never get anywhere. You will just be a creative genius. If you only use the left side of your brain, you will only be an outline writer. You will just be a person who writes outlines. But when you use both sides of your brain, you’re a story writer.

The outline is a map of your story. It tells you where the story goes. It shows you where you are going. It is the path of your story.

Once you have this map, you need to start writing. Writing is like driving a car on a very long journey. You don’t worry about where you are going to stop or sleep, you just drive.

You will end up where you are supposed to end up. You might be going in the wrong direction, but you will get there. The point of your story is to finish; it doesn’t matter how long it takes you.

If you have an ending in mind, then you will get there. All you have to do is follow the map.

WRITING

Writing is the act of creating a story. It is the transformation of words into a story. Writing is a natural part of the story-creation process.

It is a means to an end. It is not an end in and of itself. It is a means to an end.

Writers use a lot of vocabulary to describe writing. It is not necessary to know all of these words; it only matters that you understand what they mean.

Once you understand the basic process, you can learn all the fancy vocabulary.

TALKING WITH THE WRITER

Writing is a natural part of the process. Once you have the outline, you just sit down and write. Remember, you want to write a complete story. Don’t worry about editing, or spelling, or grammar, or any of that stuff. Just write the story. You can clean it up later.

If you are writing a scene or chapter and you get stuck, ask yourself these questions:

1. What is the character’s goal?


2. What is the conflict?


3. What is the action?


4. What is the emotion?


5. What is the complication?


If you get stuck, try answering one of these questions. If that doesn’t work, try the next question. You don’t have to answer all five questions, just one will do. As you get deeper into the story, you will find that you don’t need all five questions.

In this way, you will learn how to write a complete story. This is a valuable skill.

TALKING WITH THE WRITER’S FRIEND

The writer’s friend is like the writer’s sidekick. The writer’
