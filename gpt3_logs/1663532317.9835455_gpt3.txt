==========

In the far distant future, the solar system is composed of many different planets. One of these planets is inhabited by a race of intelligent beings that have developed a highly advanced civilization. They have also developed a form of travel that allows them to visit other planets in the solar system. One day, a group of these beings decide to visit the planet Earth. They are curious about the humans that live there and want to learn more about them. When they arrive, they find that the planet is very different from what they expected. The humans there are not the simple and unsophisticated creatures that they thought they would be. The beings from the other planet are soon discovered by the humans and they are taken captive. The humans want to know more about them and their technology. They interrogate the beings and then decide to put them on trial. At the trial, the beings are found guilty of being different and are sentenced to death. However, before they are executed, they are given a chance to prove their innocence by solving a crime that the humans have been unable to solve. The beings are put in a room with a dead body and are given a limited amount of time to solve the crime. They are able to do it and are cleared of all charges. The beings from the other planet are then able to go free and they return to their home planet.
