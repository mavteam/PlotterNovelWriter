Plan the NEXT CHAPTER into eight (8) SCENES. Give a short description for each SCENE.

STORY UP TO THIS POINT: Captain Wilder and his crew are captured by aliens after an encounter in a foreign galaxy. They are now being held hostage on board the enemy ship. Captain Wilder manages to escape but can't find his crew members. He searches for them and finds them all in different parts of the ship being held prisoner by different aliens. Captain Wilder learns that they are being held hostage until their leader agrees to surrender their planet to the aliens. Captain Wilder organizes his crew into an escape plan, but they have to find a way off the ship before it reaches its destination planet and they are turned over to their leader as prisoners. They have limited time and resources, so they must act quickly if they want to escape with their lives intact!

NEXT CHAPTER: .Wilder's captors continue to torture and experiment on him, but he does not break.

SCENE 1:

==========

Captain Wilder is taken to a new room where he is strapped to a table and his arms are stretched out. A laser beam is used to cut into his arms, and then they are sewn back together. They continue cutting into his arms until they have reached the bone. He is then taken back to his cell.

SCENE 2: Captain Wilder's crew members are taken one by one to a medical room where they are experimented on and tortured in different ways.

SCENE 3: Captain Wilder's crew members are brought into a room that looks like a torture chamber, but it is actually an escape pod that can be launched from the ship! They launch it before their captors can stop them, but the pod does not have enough fuel to reach the nearest planet, so they need more fuel or else they will die in space!

SCENE 4: The aliens take Captain Wilder's crew members back to their cells, but the aliens don't know what happened to them because the escape pod was launched without their knowledge. The aliens decide that they must find out what happened before proceeding with their plan for taking over Earth. They want Captain Wilder's cooperation in this matter, so they torture him again by burning him with lasers until he tells them what happened. He refuses and continues to lie even though he knows that his crew members have escaped on an escape pod with limited fuel! The aliens take him back to his cell where he recovers from his burns and waits for another opportunity to escape!
