In space, on a distant planet, a group of friends is living together in a small community. One day, they receive a strange signal from an unknown source. They investigate and find a huge, abandoned spaceship. Inside, they find a powerful creature that has been trapped for centuries.

They manage the task and blast off into space. MIDDLE: The creature begins to teach them about its powers and how to use them. They soon realize that they are being followed by a large, hostile ship.

They mourn their friend, but continue on, using its powers to help them navigate their way through space. END: They finally reach their destination, a planet that is teeming with life. They are able to start a new life there, using the creature's powers to help them build a new community.
