BEGINNING:

==========

In an alternative timeline, India is the leading world power and its citizens are religiously diverse. In this world, Christianity never took hold and the main religions are Hinduism, Islam, and Buddhism. The global balance of power is maintained by a tenuous balance between the three superpowers: India, China, and the United States. When a Indian charismatic religious leader begins to gain a large following, the government becomes concerned that he may upset the power balance. In order to keep him under control, they assign a female secret agent to infiltrate his organization and keep tabs on him. MIDDLE: The religious leader, whose name is Mohandas, is quickly gaining popularity and influence. The secret agent, whose name is Aaliyah, begins to have doubts about her mission as she gets to know Mohandas and his followers. She starts to question whether the government is really acting in the best interests of the people. Aaliyah's doubts turn to full-blown anger when she discovers that the government has been secretly carrying out a plan to undermine Mohandas's organization. Enraged, she decides to help Mohandas and his followers overthrow the government. END: With Aaliyah's help, Mohandas and his followers are successful in overthrowing the government. A new era of religious freedom and tolerance begins in India. However, the global balance of power is now unstable, as the other superpowers scramble to fill the power vacuum left by India. This could lead to a new world war, with devastating consequences.
