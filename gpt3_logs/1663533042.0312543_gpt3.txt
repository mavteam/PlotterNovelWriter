BEGINNING:

==========

Best friends Abbey and Jess have been planning the perfect road trip for months. They'll visit all of Jess's favorite spots from her childhood growing up in different states along the coast. But when Jess's grandma dies suddenly, the trip takes on a new meaning. Jess is determined to scatter her grandma's ashes in the ocean at each of their stopping points. Abbey and Jess set out on their journey, starting with a long drive from their home in Virginia. They make good time, stopping only for gas and food, and make it to North Carolina the first day. They decide to stop for the night and get a hotel room. The second day, they get an early start and make it to Georgia. They spend the day exploring the state, and in the evening, they find a spot on the beach to scatter Jess's grandma's ashes. The trip continues in a similar fashion as they move through Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and finally, Texas. At each stop, they explore the state, learn about its history and culture, and scatter a little bit of Jess's grandma's ashes. Along the way, they make new friends and memories, and their bond grows stronger. Eventually, they reach their final destination: California. They spend a few days exploring the state, and on the last day, they find the perfect spot to scatter the rest of Jess's grandma's ashes. With their task complete, Abbey and Jess head back home, having had the most amazing and memorable journey of their lives.
