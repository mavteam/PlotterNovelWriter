Plan the next chapter into eight (8) scenes. Give a short description for each scene.

STORY UP TO THIS POINT: Captain Wilder and Commander Krieg are investigating an emergency in the engine room when they find evidence of sabotage. They are then attacked by aliens, and the ship's weapons officer is trying to figure out how to fire the weapons. The captain and commander are taken by the creatures, who have a strange looking ship. The captain and commander are taken to an alien medical center where they are subjected to painful medical experiments. They manage to escape, but they have no idea where they are or how to get back home. They find a farm house and go inside to rest. They find a telephone book, which gives them some clues about where they might be. It also gives them the name of a doctor who treats aliens for a living. He says that he can give them some help, but it will cost them $, for each treatment. He says that he has an idea of what might help them get back home if they agree to let him experiment on them first using his "special treatment." After the doctor uses his special treatment on the captain and commander, they wake up in their own bodies again, back on their ship! They feel very strange and disoriented as if something is different about themselves somehow. They look at each other and realize that THEY ARE ALIENS now! The weapons officer tells them that something must have gone wrong with their weapons because there is no sign of any damage done by enemy fire at all! While trying desperately to figure out what happened while they were away from their ship being experimented on by the doctor, Commander Krieg notices a strange looking device with blinking lights near one of the walls while looking around with her new alien eyesight. She picks it up and examines it closely with her new alien hands which she finds much stronger than her old human hands used to be before she was transformed into an alien herself! She realizes that she can read English words printed on it now because she can see things much more clearly than before when she was human before being transformed into an alien herself by the doctor's special treatment! She reads aloud what is printed on it "WARNING - DO NOT OPEN THIS DEVICE UNTIL READY TO USE IT!" She opens it anyway even though she knows better than not doing so after seeing this warning printed on it! Inside is another box labeled "ONE TIME USE ONLY" which contains a small black plastic device shaped like a pistol grip with wires coming out one end of it leading into another box labeled "BATTERY CHARGER." After putting batteries into this device using these wires coming out of its handle end, she presses its trigger button like you would do if you were going shoot someone with a gun except nothing happens except for lights flashing inside this device's handle part like you would see when you pull back your finger off of a real gun's trigger after pulling its trigger back yourself when you're going shoot someone who deserves shooting anyway just like those aliens deserved being shot themselves for attacking our spaceships first instead of waiting until we attacked THEM first instead of letting us live in peace without bothering us until we bothered THEM first instead of waiting until WE attacked THEM first before THEY attacked US first just because WE did OURS properly FIRST without making silly mistakes like leaving fingerprints behind everywhere we went so we could be easily identified later when OUR fingerprints were discovered everywhere those aliens had been visiting and visiting often BEFORE we ever visited THEM anywhere even once yet even though WE never did anything UNTIL THEY DID SOMETHING FIRST so why did THEY attack US FIRST instead of waiting until WE attacked THEM FIRST? And WHY didn't THEY do THEIR HOMEWORK PROPERLY BEFORE ATTACKING US JUST BECAUSE WE DID OURS PROPERLY FIRST WITHOUT MAKING SILLY MISTAKES LIKE LEAVING FINGERPRINTS BEHIND EVERYWHERE WE WENT?  Wilder and Krieg are sitting in the cockpit of their ship, trying to figure out what happened to them while they were away from their ship being experimented on by the doctor.
