Aahana is eventually broken out of prison by the Resistance, and she joins their fight against the Consortium. The story follows the struggle of the Resistance as they try to overthrow the Consortium and free India from their control. Along the way, the characters must face many challenges, both from the Consortium and from the treacherous environment of the post-apocalyptic world. ENDING: After years of fighting, the Resistance finally defeats the Consortium and restores freedom to India. Aahana becomes a symbol of hope for the people of India, and she is instrumental in rebuilding the country in the aftermath of the war.
