==========

Life on planet Quartus is hard. The sun is beating down on the small desert planet, and the only way to survive is by huddling in the shade of the rocky outcroppings. Water is scarce, and what little there is, is undrinkable. The native Quartians are a hardy people, but they're struggling to survive. Enter the Earthlings. A team of astronauts, sent to Quartus on a mission to find a new planet to colonize. Upon arrival, they are immediately attacked by the Quartians. A brutal battle ensues, and the Earthlings are victorious. The Earthlings take over the planet, and start to build a new society. They quickly realize that the Quartians are not the only ones struggling to survive on the planet. There are other creatures, native to Quartus, that are also trying to make a living in the harsh conditions. The Earthlings decide to help the Quartians, and the other creatures, to build a new society that can thrive on the planet. They teach the Quartians how to grow food, and how to purify the water. They build homes, and create a government. The new society is not without its problems, but it is a vast improvement over the life the Quartians had before. However, there is one problem that the Earthlings can't solve. The sun. The sun is beating down on the planet, and is slowly killing the inhabitants. The Earthlings try to find a way to stop the sun, but they are unsuccessful. They realize that the only way to save the planet is to find a way to reflect the sun's rays away from the planet. The Earthlings build a giant mirror, and reflect the sun's rays away from the planet. The mirror is successful, and the planet is saved. But the cost is high. The Earthlings have to leave the planet, and can never come back. The Quartians are left to fend for themselves, but they are now better equipped to survive. They have food, and water. They have homes, and a government. They have hope.
