Write a concise summary of the following story.


A human crew helps an alien planet win a war, but their captain is captured and taken prisoner. The crew rescues the captain before he can be tortured, but he is suffering from hallucinations caused by exposure to an alien plant. They find an alien spaceship and fly back to their own ship. The captain is able to see through the eyes of the aliens and realizes his crewmates are being attacked. He screams for them to run, but they are all killed. The aliens are killed when their ship explodes before they can remove Wilder's second eye. 

The captain sees all the different paths his life could have taken and all the different ways his ship and crew could have died. He wakes up in a strange place being held prisoner by a giant creature who tells him it is time for him to die. The creature offers to kill everyone on board Wilder's ship except for Wilder who would then be allowed one last request before being killed? 

Wilder breaks free and returns to his ship where he confronts his crew. The crew decides they will not destroy their captain, but they will leave him behind on an alien planet and return home without him. They realize the aliens are still chasing them and they must destroy their own ship or be killed by the aliens or by their captain.  The ship is damaged. The crew is in danger. The crew is hiding from the aliens. They are preparing to fight back. The captain has been captured and tortured by the aliens. He has been blinded and he is hallucinating. He sees his dead crewmates and he screams for them to run. They cannot hear him, but they do run in fear of the aliens chasing them. They are all killed by the aliens before they can escape into a cave and hide from them. The alien ship explodes, killing all the aliens on board, including those who were torturing Wilder's crewmates in their own bodies while they were alive on their own ship. The captain wakes up in a strange place being held prisoner by a giant creature who tells him it is time for him to die. He tries to convince the creature he does not want to die yet, but he cannot speak its language and it does not understand what he is saying so it continues to taunt Wilder about his impending death until Wilder breaks free from its grasp and returns to his ship where he confronts his crew about what happened to his crewmates on the alien planet where they left him behind when they returned home without him after destroying their own ship rather than let the aliens capture their spaceship too so that they could return home alive instead of dead as a result of being killed by Wilder on board their own ship after returning home without him as well as having been killed by Wilder's insane hallucinations while still on board their own spaceship before returning home with no one left alive except for himself because everyone else was killed by either one or both of two different alien species (the first alien species being those who tortured Wilder's crewmates after capturing them as prisoners of war during an interplanetary war which was fought between two different alien species with each alien species being made up of three different types of sentient beings - one type being very large, another type being quite small, and another type being medium sized - while the second alien species was made up entirely of intelligent beings who were much larger than humans with only one eye apiece that were capable of seeing through any number of other eyes simultaneously - one eye at a time - when those eyes belonged to members of any other sentient species).
