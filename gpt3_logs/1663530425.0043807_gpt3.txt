BEGINNING:

==========

In the 23rd century, humanity has colonized other solar systems and life is mostly peaceful. However, there is always the potential for conflict and violence, as is the case with any society. Some people are just naturally inclined towards deviant and twisted behavior, no matter how much society tries to stop it.

Enter Our protagonists, a couple who seem to have it all. They're rich, beautiful, and in love with each other. However, there's a dark side to their relationship that not even they can admit to themselves. They're both incredibly violent people, quick to lose their tempers and lash out at each other, even though they promised each other that they would never do that again.

As the story progresses, we see the couple's relationship slowly deteriorating as their violence and dark desires consume them. Eventually, they reach a breaking point where they can no longer deny what they've become. They erupt into a final, furious fight that leaves them both battered and bruised.

MIDDLE:

In the aftermath of their final fight, the couple is forced to confront the reality of their relationship. They realize that they can no longer deny the truth: they're both terrible people who are only capable of causing each other pain.

They try to separate, but they can't seem to stay away from each other. They're drawn back together by their shared violence and dark desires. They start to spiral further and further down, until they're both consumed by their darker impulses.

The couple's downward spiral culminates in a brutal murder. They kill someone close to them in a fit of rage, finally fully embracing their dark side.

END:

After killing someone close to them, the couple is finally arrested and put on trial. They're both found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.

In prison, the couple is finally forced to face the consequences of their actions. They're both incredibly remorseful and regretful, but they know that they can never go back to the way things were.

The story ends with the couple still in prison, but at peace with themselves. They've come to terms with what they've done and they're finally able to move on with their lives.
