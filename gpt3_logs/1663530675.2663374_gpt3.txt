However, things do not go as planned. The aliens do not respond to the signals that the ship is sending. The ship is forced to land on the alien spacecraft. Once aboard the alien spacecraft, the representatives quickly realize that they are not alone. There are other human beings on the ship, people who were taken from their homes by the aliens. These people have been living on the ship for generations. As the representatives explore the ship, they come to learn that the aliens are not the only ones aboard. There are also other creatures, some of which are hostile. The representatives must find a way to escape the ship and get back to their own people. END: The representatives eventually find a way off the alien spacecraft. They return to their own people with the knowledge that there are other human beings out there, living on other planets. This experience changes the way people all over the planet think about their place in the universe. No longer are they alone. They are now part of a larger community.
