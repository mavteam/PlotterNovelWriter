They discuss their options while walking down a hallway toward an escape pod, and they must act quickly before it is too late!

NEXT CHAPTER: .They remove his eyes and insert two strange orbs in their place.

SCENE 1:

==========

Captain Wilder awakens in a small room with a metallic table. He is strapped down to it, and he feels his head and discovers that his eyes have been removed. He struggles with the straps and breaks free, but then he falls to the floor.

SCENE 2: Captain Wilder regains his senses and gets up off the floor, but then he feels a sharp pain in his back and falls again. He tries again, but this time he crawls on the floor toward the door. He manages to open it by pulling on it with all his strength, but then he loses consciousness again.

SCENE 3: Captain Wilder awakens for a third time and realizes that he is no longer tied down to the table. He gets up off the floor and sees an eye-shaped object on top of a shelf across from him. He reaches for it, but then something hits him from behind and knocks him out again!

SCENE 4: Captain Wilder wakes up for a fourth time and finds himself lying on the table with straps around his wrists and ankles. A strange alien walks over to him with a needle in one hand, so Captain Wilder struggles against his bindings until they break free! The alien injects something into him, so Captain Wilder punches out the alien with one punch! The alien lies unconscious on the floor next to him, so Captain Wilder takes off running toward an escape pod!
