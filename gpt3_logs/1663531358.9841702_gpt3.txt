==========

It's Christmas time and the holidays are in full swing. But up in space, things are a little different. The crew of the International Space Station is preparing for a special Christmas mission. They're going to attempt to orbit a giant Christmas tree in an effort to spread holiday cheer to everyone on Earth. But as they enter into orbit, they realize that the tree is much heavier than they anticipated. And soon, the tree starts to pull the space station out of orbit! The crew must work together to save their own lives and the Christmas tree. MIDDLE: As the space station falls towards Earth, the crew must use everything they can to save themselves. They use the Christmas tree to cushion their fall and eventually land safely. But they're not out of danger yet. The tree is still pulling them towards a nearby mountain. The crew must now use all their skills to climb the mountain and save the tree. But as they get higher and higher, they realize that the tree is too heavy to carry. They must find a way to lighten the load. END: Finally, the crew reaches the top of the mountain. But as they start to descend, the tree starts to slide. It's going to crush them! At the last minute, the crew cuts the tree in half, lightening the load and saving their lives. They make it safely back to the space station and Christmas is saved.
