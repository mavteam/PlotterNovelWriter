Plan the NEXT CHAPTER into eight (8) SCENES. Describe each SCENE with one or two sentences.

STORY UP TO THIS POINT: A human crew helps an alien planet win a war, but their captain is captured and taken prisoner. The crew rescues the captain before he can be tortured, but he is suffering from hallucinations caused by exposure to an alien plant. They find an alien spaceship and fly back to their own ship. The captain is able to see through the eyes of the aliens and realizes his crewmates are being attacked. He screams for them to run, but they are all killed. The aliens are killed when their ship explodes before they can remove Wilder's second eye.

NEXT CHAPTER: 24.He is a changed man, but he is still the same strong and determined leader his crew knows and loves.

SCENE 1:

==========

The crew is gathered in the mess hall for a meeting. The captain is still weak and frail, but he has been given a clean bill of health by the ship's doctor. He tells them that their next mission will be to help an alien planet win a war against their enemy, the Kretons. He explains that they are an aggressive species who want to rule the entire galaxy. The Kretons have been attacking planets and forcing them to join their empire. The aliens have no chance against the Kretons' superior weapons and technology, but they have developed a chemical weapon that will kill all of the Kreton soldiers on their planet without harming any of their own people. They need help transporting it to their planet so they can distribute it throughout their atmosphere before the Kretons invade.

MISSION: Help transport chemical weapons to an alien world so they can use it against invading forces from another planet.



SCENE 2: The crew arrives at the alien world's space station and boards a small shuttle craft with three other ships from different planets that are also helping transport weapons to this world. They fly through space toward the planet below, but they are attacked by a fleet of Kreton warships in orbit around the planet. Their shuttle is hit with several laser blasts before they can escape into hyperspace and return fire at the attacking ships with their own cannons.

SCENE 3: The shuttle arrives safely at one of two landing pads on an enormous ship that serves as both a space station and military fortress for this world's defense forces. They are greeted by military leaders who thank them for helping them fight back against the Kretons' invasion plans for this world. They tell them that all of these ships are carrying enough chemicals to kill every living thing on this planet except for its native inhabitants, which means that it will take weeks or months before all of these chemicals spread throughout this world's atmosphere and reach lethal levels for humans, too. They tell them it will take several days before all of these chemicals can be transported down to ground level using giant airships because there isn't enough room in any one airship to carry everything needed for this job in one trip down to ground level, so many trips will have to be made over a period of several days or weeks depending on how fast each airship can travel between each landing site and its home port aboard this massive ship in orbit above this world's surface below.

MISSION: Help transport chemicals from space stations orbiting above ground level down onto ground level where they need to be distributed throughout an entire planet's atmosphere within several days or weeks depending on how fast each airship can travel between each landing site and its home port aboard this massive ship in orbit above this world's surface below
