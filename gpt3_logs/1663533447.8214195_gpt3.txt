BEGINNING:

==========

It is the year 320 AD. The once great Empire of Rome is in ruins. The once mighty legions have been reduced to a shadow of their former selves. The once invincible legions have been defeated and driven out of Britain. The last remnants of the once great Empire are now camped out in a small town in the middle of nowhere in the province of Gaul. The people of the town are eking out a meager existence, trying to stay out of the way of the legions and the bands of marauding barbarians. Life is hard, but it is what it is. One day, a Stranger comes to town. He is a tall, dark-haired man with a scar on his cheek. He is wearing a strange set of armor that no one has ever seen before. The Stranger doesn't say much, but he seems to have a purpose. The Stranger is looking for someone. He is looking for a woman named Valeria. Valeria is a young woman who is living in the town with her mother and father. Valeria is a beautiful young woman, and she has caught the eye of the Stranger. The Stranger is not the only one who is interested in Valeria. There is also a Roman centurion named Marcus. Marcus is a career soldier who has been in the legions for many years. He is a good man, but he is getting old. Marcus is interested in Valeria because he wants to retire and settle down. Valeria is torn between the two men. On the one hand, there is the Stranger, who is mysterious and exciting. On the other hand, there is Marcus, who is safe and predictable. Valeria decides to go with the Stranger. She is drawn to his mysteriousness and the adventure that he represents. Marcus is heartbroken, but he doesn't give up. He decides to follow the Stranger and Valeria. Marcus follows the Stranger and Valeria to a nearby city. The city is under siege by a barbarian horde. The city is about to fall, and the inhabitants are desperate. The Stranger and Valeria are able to get into the city and help the people defend it. Marcus is also able to get into the city, but he is captured by the barbarian horde. The Stranger and Valeria are able to repel the barbarian horde and save the city. Marcus is able to escape from the barbarian camp and make his way back to the city. After the city is saved, the Stranger and Valeria ride off into the sunset, leaving Marcus behind. END: The story ends with the Stranger and Valeria living happily ever after. Marcus is left behind, bitter and alone.
