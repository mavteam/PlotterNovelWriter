==========

It is the late Renaissance period in America and various religions are practiced by the people. Our story follows a cast of characters who are religiously diverse and have different backgrounds in their respective religions. Despite their differences, they all maintain an active level of involvement in their religion, which shapes a large part of their lives. The story begins with each of the characters going about their daily lives, attending religious services and participating in religious ceremonies and traditions. They all lead fairly peaceful and normal lives until theirs faiths are put to the test. One character, a young girl, is faced with the death of her parents. This prompts her to question her religious beliefs and whether or not there is a God who can protect and comfort her in her time of need. another character, a boy, is constantly bullied by his classmates for being different. He also begins to doubt his religious beliefs and wonders if there is a God who can help him through this tough time. To make matters worse, a new threat arises that threatens to destroy everything they hold dear. A group of fundamentalist Christians begin a crusade against all non-believers, driving them from their homes and workplaces and subjecting them to violence and persecution. The characters are forced to band together to survive. They must put their differences aside and unite against a common enemy. In the process, they learn to appreciate and respect each other's beliefs, and they come to realize that, despite their different faiths, they all worship the same God. The story climaxes with the characters leading a daring escape from the city under siege, and eventually finding safety and freedom. The ending is a feel-good one, with the characters living happily ever after in a world where tolerance and understanding prevail.
