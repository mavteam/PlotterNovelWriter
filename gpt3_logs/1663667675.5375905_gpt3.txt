She was taken to the aliens' home world and subjected to unthinkable torture. As she suffered, Susan's mind started to unravel. She began to question who she was and what her purpose was. She wondered if she would ever escape and return to her ship and crew. Susan's captors continued to torture and experiment on her, but she did not break.

She also saw a way to escape. Susan finally broke free from her captors and made her way back to her ship. She was driven by a single purpose: to find and rescue her crew.
