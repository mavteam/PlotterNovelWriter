Chapter 8


The First Five Pages


I am not going to tell you what to write, but I am going to tell you how to write it. You can’t go wrong if you follow these simple suggestions.


1) Write as if your reader is sitting right across from you or standing next to you—in other words, write as if your reader is present. If your reader is present, he or she will be interested in what you have to say. If your reader is absent, no matter how good your writing may be, it will fall flat for the simple reason that there is no one there to appreciate it. If your reader isn’t present when you write, he or she won’t be there when you read what you have written either!


2) Write about something that interests YOU! It doesn’t matter what it is—it could be dinosaurs or ancient Egypt or how to play golf—but whatever it is, pick something that interests YOU! If it doesn’t interest YOU and excite YOU, why should anyone else be interested? There are lots of things in this world that interest me but don’t interest other people—so I don’t write about them! Writing should be fun! You should enjoy yourself while writing; otherwise why bother? And if readers don’t enjoy reading what they have read before they start reading it again—and then again and again—they won’t bother reading anything else by YOU ever again! So pick something that interests YOU and excites YOU so much that you want to share it with others who will also enjoy reading about it as much as YOU enjoyed writing about it!


3) Write simply and clearly so everyone can understand what you mean without having to work hard at understanding what you mean! Don’t use big words just because they sound impressive. Don’t use long words just because they sound impressive either. Be clear and simple so everyone can understand everything easily without having to work very hard at understanding anything at all! Remember the KISS principle (keep it short and simple stupid). The harder people have to work at reading something the less interested they will become in reading any more of whatever it is they are trying so hard to understand in the first place. So make everything easy for them by making everything easy for yourself first by being clear and simple from the very beginning of whatever story or novel or article or poem or essay or report or outline…whatever…you choose…to write…and stay that way throughout every word of every sentence of every paragraph of every page of every chapter of every book until the very last word…and beyond into eternity if necessary because nothing lasts forever except God Himself (and even He has promised not forever).


4) Write with a purpose—a purpose which moves your story forward toward its climax (the point where everything comes together). Everything must move forward toward its climax; nothing can move backward toward its beginning unless we want our story (or novel) to end up nowhere except nowhere at all which makes no sense at all because stories (or novels) must end somewhere even if only ending with nothing happening after an hour has passed between chapters with nothing happening between scenes with nothing happening between sentences with nothing happening between paragraphs with nothing happening between pages with nothing happening between chapters with nothing happening after five hundred pages have been written leading nowhere except nowhere at all which makes no sense at all because stories (or novels) must end somewhere even if only ending with nothing happening after an hour has passed between chapters leading nowhere except nowhere at all which makes no sense at all because stories (or novels) must end somewhere even if only ending with nothing happening after an hour has passed between chapters leading nowhere except nowhere at all which makes no sense at all because stories (or novels) must end somewhere even if only ending with nothing happening after an hour has passed between chapters leading nowhere except nowhere at all which makes no sense…and so on ad infinitum ad nauseam ad absurdum ad finitum ad nihilo until time itself comes full circle back where we started from long before time was created along with everything else including God Himself who created time along with everything else including us who were created long before time was created along with everything else including God Himself who created time along with everything else including us who were created long before time was created along with everything else including God Himself who created time along…with us who were created…alongside Him whom we were never able to create alongside Him
