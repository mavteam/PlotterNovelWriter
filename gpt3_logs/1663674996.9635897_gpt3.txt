Plan the NEXT CHAPTER into eight (8) SCENES. Describe each SCENE with one or two sentences.

STORY UP TO THIS POINT: A human crew discovers an alien planet that is being attacked by another tribe. They help the aliens win the war, discover a hidden chamber, and are eventually able to escape back to their own ship. However, their captain is captured and taken prisoner by the aliens. The crew searches for their captain and rescues him before he can be tortured by the aliens. They find an alien spaceship and fly back to their own ship. The captain is suffering from hallucinations.

NEXT CHAPTER: 16.Wilder's captors become frustrated with him and decide to subject him to a final, brutal experiment.

SCENE 1:

==========

Wilder is taken to the alien spaceship and strapped into a chair. The aliens strap his arms and legs to the chair. They turn on a machine that will subject him to painful, bright lights. Wilder's eyes are taped open so he can't close them. The lights begin to flash on and off. Wilder screams in pain as the aliens watch from behind glass.

SCENE 2: The aliens observe Wilder's reaction to the lights for a moment and then leave the room. They turn off the lights and leave him alone for a few moments with his eyes still taped open, watching him writhe in pain. Then they come back in and turn on the lights again, but this time they increase their intensity until they are almost unbearable. Again, Wilder screams in pain as they watch behind glass.

SCENE 3: The aliens increase the intensity of the light even more until it becomes unbearable again. This time, Wilder faints from the pain before they have a chance to observe his reaction any further. He is unconscious for several hours while they experiment with other methods of torture.

SCENE 4: When he wakes up, he is still strapped into the chair with his eyes taped open and is surrounded by several of these strange creatures that look like giant insects or centipedes or something else completely alien-looking that he has never seen before in his life! He can't believe what he is seeing! One of them walks over toward him with a strange-looking device that looks like an electric cattle prod or something along those lines... It has two prongs sticking out from it... It looks like it might be used for something else besides torture... but what? What could it possibly be used for? It looks like some kind of weapon or torture device... or both! As it approaches closer and closer toward him, he begins to realize that this thing might be used as some kind of sexual device! He begins to panic! He tries desperately to get free from his bonds but there's no way! They're too tight! He panics even more when he realizes that this creature may have been sent here by its leader (the alien queen) as a gift! These creatures are known to exchange gifts with each other during special ceremonies... And what better gift could she give her new husband than one of these creatures? (She already gave him one as part of their marriage ceremony.) What if she wants another one? He tries desperately not to think about it but there's no escaping reality... This thing may be coming at any moment now... What will happen if she comes back now? What if she thinks that he likes this thing?! She'll think that he really wants this thing! She'll probably want another one so she can give them both together as her wedding present!!! What if...?!!! No!!! NO!!! NO!!! NO!!! NO!!! NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! AAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! OH GOD!!!! OH GOD!!!! OH GOD!!!! OH GOD!!!! OH GOD!!!! OH GOD!!!!! AAAAHHHHHHH!!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!





Wilder wakes up screaming at night in bed while sleeping next to his wife who is sound asleep beside him snoring away peacefully without even realizing what just happened...
