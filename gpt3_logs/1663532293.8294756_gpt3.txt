One day, a group of hunters goes out into the wilderness in search of food.

The hunters manage to kill the animals, but not before they suffer some serious injuries. One of the hunters, a young man named Hyrkanus, is gravely wounded in the attack. His friends carry him back to the village, but it is clear that he will not survive. Hyrkanus knows that his time is limited, and he asks his friends to take him to see the great pyramids of Egypt before he dies.

He asks his friends to tell his people that he died happy, and then he passes away.

As they work, they uncover more and more of the secrets that the pyramids hold.
