BEGINNING:

==========

In a remote village in Italy, sightings of a strange creature have been reported. Some say it is a monster, others say it is a ghost. The villagers are divided on what to believe. One night, a young woman named Giovanna is out walking near the forest when she sees the creature for herself. She screams in terror and runs back to the village to warn everyone. The news of the creature spreads quickly and soon the whole village is in a panic. The villagers decide to ask for help from a group of local hunters who are known for their monster-killing skills. The hunters arrive and begin to search for the creature. They track it to its lair in the forest and prepare to kill it. However, when they see the creature, they realize that it is not a monster or a ghost, but a young boy who is lost and scared. The hunters take the boy back to the village where he is reunited with his relieved family. The village is now filled with a new feeling of hope and happiness. MIDDLE: One day, a traveling circus comes to the village. The villagers are excited to see the show and flock to the circus tent. However, the circus is not what it seems. The clowns are frightening, the acrobats are deadly, and the ringmaster is a sinister magician. Soon, the villagers realize that they are in grave danger. The clowns start to kidnap people, and the acrobats begin to kill them. The ringmaster uses his magic to control the minds of the villagers. Giovanna is one of the few people who remains free from the circus's control. She knows that she has to stop the circus before it destroys the village. Giovanna comes up with a plan and, with the help of the hunters, she is able to defeat the circus and save the village. END: The village is returned to its normal state and the people are safe once again. Giovanna is hailed as a hero. She is now known as the girl who saved the village from the evil circus.
