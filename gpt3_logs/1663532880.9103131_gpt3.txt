They learn that the civilization was destroyed by a massive conflict that ripped it apart. The war was fought with devastating weapons that obliterated the city and killed everyone in it. As the group continues to explore the city, they come across the remains of the civilization's leaders. The leaders were all killed in the conflict. The group also finds the remains of the civilization's military. The military was wiped out in the conflict.

END: The film ends with the group returning to Earth. They are changed by their experience and determined to prevent such a tragedy from happening again.
