The crew of the Ernest Rutherford manage to get the ship ready to leave, but they are attacked by aliens and crash land again. Trapped on the ship, the crew figures out a way to defeat the aliens and escape. Wilder is taken prisoner by the aliens and taken to their home world. He is injected with a drug and taken to a medical facility where the aliens examine him. Wilder is taken back to his cell, but he escapes and makes his way back to the Ernest Rutherford.
