Set in the 3rd century BCE, our story follows the escapades of a ragtag group of spacefarers as they travel the cosmos in search of adventure. Led by the dashing and charismatic captain, the crew of the starship fumble their way through one scrappy battle after another, quickly gaining a reputation as the galaxy's most unlikely heroes. But life in space is not all fun and games, and as the crew soon discovers, they are not the only ones with their sights set on adventure. The evil empire is hot on their trail, determined to put an end to their merry band of rebels. With the empire's forces closing in, the crew must use all their wits and firepower to stay one step ahead. Middle: As the crew evades the empire's forces, they also find themselves caught up in the middle of an brewing romance.

Meanwhile, the ship's engineer starts to suspect that the new navigator may have ulterior motives. With enemies both in front of them and behind, the crew must prepare for the ultimate showdown. With the odds stacked against them, they will need to summon all their courage and ingenuity to come out on top.

The captain and first mate finally admit their feelings for each other, but decide that it is best to part ways. The engineer and navigator also go their separate ways, but not before sharing a final, passionate kiss. The crew says goodbye to their fallen comrades and sets off into the great unknown, ready to take on whatever adventure comes their way.
