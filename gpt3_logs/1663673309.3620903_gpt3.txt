Plan the NEXT CHAPTER into eight (8) SCENES. Describe each SCENE in great detail, with a beginning, middle, and end.

STORY UP TO THIS POINT: Captain Wilder and Ensign O'Neil find a wormhole while exploring the Alpha Centauri system. They take the Ernest Rutherford through the wormhole and find themselves in the middle of a battle between an alien ship and a ship from a different galaxy. The aliens shoot the Ernest Rutherford's engines, causing the ship to crash-land on a nearby planet. The crew manages to get to the damaged ship and get it ready to leave. Ensign O'Neil takes a shuttle to the alien ship and opens the hangar bay doors so that the Ernest Rutherford can fly out. They head back towards the wormhole. The aliens come from all directions, shattering the shields. The Ernest Rutherford is hit by a powerful blast that knocks the ship out of control. The shields go down and the aliens attack the ship's hull with laser beams. The aliens shoot the Ernest Rutherford's engines again and the ship crashes on a nearby planet. With communications down, the ship's computer initiates a lockdown. The crew runs from section to section, sealing themselves in. The aliens shoot the Ernest Rutherford's engines, breaking through the hull and setting the ship on fire.
