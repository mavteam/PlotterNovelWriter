BEGINNING:

==========

Korea is in the throes of the late Renaissance, and tensions are running high. The country is divided between those who believe in the old ways and those who are embracing the new, and the two sides are constantly at odds. One night, a group of young people from the new generation are out celebrating at a club. They're laughing and having a good time, but their fun is interrupted when a group of older, traditionalist Koreans start harassing them. The situation quickly escalates and a fight breaks out. One of the young people is stabbed in the scuffle, and the group quickly flees the scene. They end up at the home of one of their friends, a young woman named Jae-hee. She's from a wealthy family and they're worried that she'll be in trouble if her parents find out what happened. Jae-hee decides to take matters into her own hands and goes to the club to confront the older Koreans. She ends up getting into another fight, and this time she's the one who's stabbed. The young people rush her to the hospital, but it's too late. Jae-hee dies from her injuries, and the group is left reeling from the tragedy. While they're grieving, the group decides to take action. They start a campaign to raise awareness about the growing division in Korea and the violence that's being perpetrated against the new generation. Their campaign quickly gains traction and soon the whole country is talking about the issue. The government is forced to take notice and they start to implement changes. The young people's campaign is successful, but it comes at a cost. They've lost one of their own, and they'll never be able to forget what happened.
