The leader of the aliens is told that a human prisoner has been taken and will be turned over to him. Captain Wilder wakes up in a cell on the alien's home planet. He looks around and sees that he is alone in the cell. He looks around for a way to escape but finds none. He tries to get out of the cell but finds it impossible, so he sits down, wondering what they are going to do with him and how they are going to torture him. One of the aliens opens his cell door and tells him to come with them. They take him down a long hallway and into an elevator that takes them up several floors in the building. They exit the elevator and walk down another long hallway until they reach an area where there are many other cells just like his on both sides of the hall. They open one of these cells, walk inside, and motion for Captain Wilder to follow them inside as well. He does so, wondering what is going on here? Why are all these cells being opened? Are they going to put all their prisoners together? What are they planning on doing with them? The aliens lock Captain Wilder inside one of these cells, grab his arms, turn him around and push him against a wall! They place their hands on either side of his head! Suddenly he feels like he's being pulled apart! His mind starts racing at a million miles per hour! What are they doing?! What have they done to me?! What's happening?! Suddenly everything goes black as he feels himself losing consciousness!
