The story centers on a young woman named Amina, who was born with the ability to see the future. When she was a child, she had a vision of a great floodsweeping across the land, and her village was destroyed in just such a flood. Since then, Amina has been wandering the land, using her powers to help others. One day, Amina has a vision of a young woman in peril, and she sets off to find her. When she finds the woman, she is being chased by a Naga. Amina is able to help the woman escape, but she is bitten by the Naga in the process. MIDDLE: Amina is taken in by the woman she saved, who lives in a small village. The village is plagued by a number of problems, including a recent drought and a lack of food.

The Naga starts appearing to Amina in her waking life as well, and she realizes that it is trying to drive her insane. She starts to doubt her own sanity, but she continues to use her powers to help the village. One day, the Naga finally catches up to Amina. It disguises itself as a child, and Amina takes it in. The Naga then takes control of Amina's body, and starts to wreak havoc in the village. END: Amina is able to break free from the Naga's control, but it has already done a lot of damage. The village is in ruins, and many of the villagers are dead. Amina is able to use her powers to help the survivors, and she eventually kills the Naga. With the Naga gone, the village is able to rebuild and start to thrive again. Amina remains with the village, using her powers to help them.
