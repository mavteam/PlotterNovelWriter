STORY UP TO THIS POINT: The crew of a damaged ship lands on an unknown planet. They encounter a tribe of aliens and help them win a war against another tribe. They discover a hidden chamber in the alien city and are preparing to leave when a large spaceship lands. The ship's captain tells them they are forbidden to explore and orders them to join his army. A crew member tries to escape but is captured before he can get away. The captain is kidnapped and taken to a spaceship. The crew searches for their captain and finds him locked in a cell. They fight off the alien guards and escape with their captain. The crew searches the underground chamber and finds a large, round object. The captain decides to take the object back to the ship. He orders several crew members to return to the ship and prepare for takeoff while the rest of his crew stays behind to guard the ship. The aliens attack while the crew is still on planet. Some of them are killed before they can get inside their ship, but they manage to get inside and take off. The aliens follow them into space, but they are unable to keep up with their damaged ship. They are forced to return home without their captain or his prisoner, Wilder.

SCENE 5: The aliens ask Wilder questions about his race and his planet. They also ask him questions about the human race and their planet, Earth. They want to know if they can conquer Earth, but they are unable to understand or believe anything he tells them. They are especially interested in the fact that humans have only one gender and do not reproduce sexually. They want to know why humans have no more than two genders when other species have more than two genders, but they are unable to understand or believe anything he tells them about it either. They do not believe that humans only have one gender because they look like men and women, and they do not believe that humans only have one gender because men and women can produce offspring together even though they do not reproduce sexually with each other either because it does not make sense for a species to reproduce sexually with others of its own species when other species can reproduce without needing anyone else of their own species at all. One alien asks him why humans need such large brains when all they do is think silly thoughts while another alien asks him why humans need such small bodies when all they do is eat food while another alien asks him why humans need such small mouths when all they do is eat food while another alien asks him why humans need such large noses when all they do is breathe air while another alien asks him why humans need such large ears when all they do is hear sounds while another alien asks him why humans need such large eyes when all they do is see things while another alien asks him why humans need such small genitals when all they do is urinate while another alien asks him how he knows so much about human anatomy since he has never seen a human before since he has no idea what a human looks like since he has never seen a human before since his people have only one gender so how could he know what a human looks like since his people have only one gender so how could he know what a human looks like since his people have only one gender so how could he know what a human looks like as long as it does not make sense for them to reproduce sexually with each other either because it does not make sense for them to be able to produce offspring together even though she does not want anyone else of her own species at all as long as it does not make sense for them to reproduce sexually with each other either because it makes no sense for her to be able to produce offspring together even though she does not want anyone else of her own species at all as long as it does not make sense for them to reproduce sexually with each other either because it makes no sense for her to be able to produce offspring together even though she does not want anyone else of her own species at all as long as it does not make sense for them to reproduce sexually with each other either because it makes no sense for her mate's mate's mate's mate's son's son's son's son's son's son's daughter-in-law's daughter-in-law's daughter-in-law's daughter-in-law's daughter-in-law or any of his sons' sons' sons' sons' sons' daughters or any of their daughters' daughters' daughters' daughters' daughters or any of their grandchildrens grandchildrens grandchildrens grandchildrens grandchildrens or any of their great great great great great great great granddaughters granddaughters granddaughters granddaughters granddaughters or any of their grandsons grandsons grandsons grandsons grandsons or any of their great great great great great great grandchildrens grandchildrens grandchildrens grandchildrens grandchildrens ever seen a single man before? He says that some members of the crew are still alive on this planet, but the aliens will never find them no matter how hard they look because there are many places on this planet where men cannot go where men cannot go where men cannot go where men cannot go where men cannot go where men cannot go where men cannot go where men cannot go where men cannot go where men cannot go where men cannot go where men cannot go where men cannot go where man can't get man can't get man can't get man can't get man can't get man can't get man can't get man can't get man can't get man can't get man can't get there there there there there there there there there anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway anyway and if you did find some surviving crew members you would kill them too just like you killed my friends just like you killed my friends just like you killed my friends just like you killed my friends just like you killed my friends just like you killed my friends just like you killed my friends
