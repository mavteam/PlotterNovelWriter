He is the only one left alive, and he is devastated. He decides to leave his hometown and travel to another town in hopes of finding work and a new life. On the way, he comes across a group of men who are being brutally attacked by a group of bandits. He intervenes and saves the men, but is badly injured in the process. The men he saved turn out to be martial arts masters, and they take him in and teach him everything they know. Karim becomes a master himself, and eventually returns to his hometown to take revenge on the bandit who killed his family. He defeats the bandit and his entire army, but at great cost. Most of his friends and mentors are killed in the battle, and Karim is left completely alone. MIDDLE: The middle of the story focuses on Karim's journey to find a new purpose in life. He travels all over Africa, helping those who cannot help themselves and fighting against evil wherever he finds it. He meets many different people, both good and bad, and slowly starts to build a new family for himself. During his travels, he hears rumors of a powerful witch doctor who is terrorizing a nearby village. He decides to investigate, and discovers that the witch doctor is using dark magic to enslave the villagers. Karim defeats the witch doctor and frees the village, but is left with a deep understanding of the evil that exists in the world. Eventually, Karim meets a woman named Fatima, who is being hunted by a group of slave traders. He protects her and defeats the slave traders, but Fatima is badly injured in the process. Karim takes her back to his home and nurses her back to health. Fatiima falls in love with Karim, but he is reluctant to return her feelings. He knows that his life is too dangerous for her, and he doesn't want her to get hurt. However, he eventually decides that he can't live without her and they get married. END: Karim and Fatima live happily together for many years, but the peace doesn't last. A new war breaks out, and Karim is drafted into the army. He doesn't want to leave Fatima, but he knows that he must fight for his country. The war is long and brutal, and takes a toll on both Karim and Fatima. They both see friends and loved ones die, and they both suffer great losses. However, they continue to fight and eventually the war comes to an end. They return home to their village, and begin to rebuild their lives. However, the peace is short-lived. A group of bandits comes to the village and starts terrorizing the people.
