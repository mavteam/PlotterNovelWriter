STORY UP TO THIS POINT: Beginning of story.

NEXT CHAPTER: 1.Captain J.T. Wilder of the starship USS Ernest Rutherford is on a five-year mission to explore deep space.

SCENE 1:

==========

Captain Wilder is alone in the starship’s command center. The ship is under automatic control. The ship has been monitoring a rogue planet for some time, and an object is headed straight for the planet.

SCENE 2: The USS Rutherford relays the object’s trajectory to Commander Orion aboard the USS Titan. Commander Orion orders the Rutherford to investigate.

SCENE 3: Captain Wilder orders helmsman Lieutenant Roger Mann to take their starship into orbit around the rogue planet. He then goes to his quarters and prepares to beam down with a landing party consisting of two special-forces soldiers, two science staff and two engineers. They will carry sensors to confirm if there is any life on this rogue planet.

SCENE 4: Captain Wilder’s team beams down onto an alien world that has a breathable atmosphere, but it also has poisonous gases in its air that will kill them if they aren’t wearing protective suits that have helmets fitted with bio-filters. They have only enough oxygen supplies for three hours on this toxic planet before they must be beamed back onto their starship or they will die from lack of oxygen, suffocation or both. They have five hours before they are completely out of oxygen and return to the ship or die on this alien world with insufficient support from their starship such as going through decompression protocols and receiving medical aid. Since this world has no known intelligent inhabitants, Captain Wilder orders his team NOT TO FIRE A SINGLE SHOT AT ANYTHING OR ANYONE! He believes that it would be unethical and illegal to fire deadly weapons at an unarmed civilization not even capable of defending itself from human beings intent on killing them without warning! He believes that he will make history by being godfather for a new civilization about to emerge into spacefaring technology! He decides NOT TO BRING THE WEAPONS BELONGING TO HIS TEAM because he doesn’t believe in using deadly force against anyone other than armed violent offenders in self-defense! Yes, he will use deadly force against another human being only if in self-defense and only when his life is threatened! This rogue planet might be inhabited by aliens who are advanced enough in technology so they could destroy all humans within months if not weeks of first contact! This rogue civilization could be much farther along than humans or even more advanced than humans in terms of technology, too far advanced for humans even now!!! This lone explorer thinks these intelligent aliens might have already discovered faster-than-light travel, perhaps even interstellar travel, too far ahead of humanity ever becoming spacefaring at all!!! That’s why he has brought NO WEAPONS OF WAR to this hostile world because he wants first contact with these superintelligent aliens as peaceful as possible so both civilizations could benefit from each other without harming one another!!! His presence here may change history forever!!! THIS IS IT!!! THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB OF HIS LIFE!!! EVER!!! Captains do NOT mess up here!! NEVER!!!! If there had been a hostile race here who wanted him DEAD upon arrival and no way around it except using deadly force against them first!, then Captains do whatever it takes including firing deadly weapons at FIRST SIGHT TO PROTECT THEIR LIVES!!!! But since there were no signs of hostility from these superintelligent aliens yet!, then Captains DO NOT fire unless fired upon FIRST by these superintelligent aliens!! So far everything looks good on this alien world so far!! WHAT LIES AHEAD FOR THIS SUPERINTELLECTUAL ROGUE PLANET AND ITS SUPERINTELLIGENT ALIENS!? FIND OUT IN THIS ENCOUNTER!!!!
