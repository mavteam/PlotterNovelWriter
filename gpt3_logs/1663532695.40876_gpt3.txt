==========

In the year 2300, the human race has colonized the moon. Life is harsh and difficult on the barren, airless satellite, but the inhabitants have made the best of it, creating a thriving community. One of the most important aspects of life on the moon is religion. The moon is home to people of all faiths, and religious belief is an important part of the community. One day, a group of religious extremists from Earth arrives on the moon, intent on causing havoc. They begin attacking the religious leaders of the community, and quickly start a full-scale riot. The community is plunged into chaos. In the midst of the chaos, a young woman named Sarah emerges as a leader. Sarah is a devout Christian, and she begins to rally the other religious leaders of the community together in an effort to restore order. With her help, they are able to calm the unrest and begin to rebuild. However, the religious extremists are not yet finished. They launch a series of attacks on the community, using powerful weapons.
