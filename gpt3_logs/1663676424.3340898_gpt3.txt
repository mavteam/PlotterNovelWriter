Plan the NEXT CHAPTER into eight (8) SCENES. Give a short description for each SCENE.

STORY UP TO THIS POINT: Captain Wilder and his crew are captured by aliens and held hostage. They are being held until their leader agrees to surrender their planet to the aliens, but Captain Wilder manages to escape. He finds his crew members being held prisoner in different parts of the ship, so they discuss their options while walking down a hallway toward an escape pod. However, they are injected with a substance that knocks them out before they can escape. Captain Wilder wakes up for a fourth time and finds himself lying on the table with straps around his wrists and ankles. A strange alien walks over to him with a needle in one hand, but Captain Wilder breaks free and punches out the alien. He then takes off running toward an escape pod!
