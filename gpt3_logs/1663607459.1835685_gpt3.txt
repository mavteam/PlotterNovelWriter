NAME: Kevin Jones
BACKSTORY: Kevin Jones was born on Earth. He always wanted to be an astronaut and explore the universe. When he was old enough, he joined the space program. He met Wilder during his training. They immediately bonded over their shared love of adventure. When Wilder was given command of the USS Ernest Rutherford, he asked Jones to be his first mate. Jones gladly accepted. He has served aboard the ship for four years. He is a good friend and trusted advisor to Wilder. He is also in love with Wilder's wife, Anna. He has never told her how he feels, but he would do anything for her.
During the course of the crew's latest mission, the ship is attacked by aliens. Jones is killed in the battle. Wilder is captured and taken prisoner. He is tortured and experimented on by the aliens. During his captivity, he has strange visions. He sees his ship and crew, but they are in different places and different times. He sees them fighting and dying, but he does not know if they are real or if they are just products of his imagination. Wilder's captors become frustrated with him and decide to subject him to a final, brutal experiment. They remove his eyes and insert two strange orbs in their place. These orbs allow Wilder to see into the past, present, and future. He sees all the different paths his life could have taken and all the different ways his ship and crew could have died. He also sees a way to escape. Wilder finally breaks free from his captors and makes his way back to his ship. He is driven by a single purpose: to find and rescue his crew. He knows it will not be easy, but he is willing to do whatever it takes. He is a changed man, but he is still the same strong and determined leader his crew knows and loves. He will stop at nothing to save them and he will not rest until they are all safe.
STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESS: Wilder is a strong and determined leader. He is fiercely loyal to his crew and he will stop at nothing to save them. He is also a changed man. He has seen the different paths his life could have taken and he is now more aware of the dangers of the universe. However, he is also more reckless and impulsive. He does not always think things through and he often acts on instinct. This can sometimes get him into trouble. Wilder's biggest weakness is his emotional state.
