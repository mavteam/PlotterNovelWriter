==========

It is 4th century BCE Korea and it is a time of great change and unrest. The Korean peninsula is in the grip of a power struggle between the three Korean kingdoms of Goguryeo, Silla, and Baekje. To the east, the Chinese Han dynasty is in decline and the country is in chaos. To the south, across the sea, the Japanese archipelago is in a period of upheaval. In the midst of this, a group of people from the Goguryeo kingdom, led by a man named Jumong, set out on a journey to find a new land to call their own. The group arrives in Japan and, after a long and difficult journey, arrives in Korea. They settle in a remote mountain valley and Jumong sets up a small kingdom there. Over the next few years, Jumong and his kingdom grow and prospered. However, the three Korean kingdoms are not content to leave Jumong and his kingdom alone and they soon launch a series of attacks against him. Jumong and his kingdom manage to hold off the attacks but they are reeling from the repeated assaults. Jumong decides to take a bold step and sends an envoy to the Han dynasty in China to seek an alliance. The envoy is successful and Han sends an army to help Jumong defend his kingdom. With the help of the Han army, Jumong and his kingdom are able to repel the attacks of the three Korean kingdoms. Jumong then turns his attention to the Japanese archipelago and begins to establish colonies there. MIDDLE: Jumong's kingdom continues to grow and prosper and he soon becomes one of the most powerful rulers in the region. However, the three Korean kingdoms are not content to sit idly by and watch Jumong's kingdom thrive. They launch a series of attacks against Jumong and his kingdom, hoping to force him to submit to their authority. Jumong and his kingdom manage to hold off the attacks but they are gradually being worn down. Jumong decides to take a gamble and sends an envoy to the Chinese Han dynasty to seek an alliance. The envoy is successful and Han sends an army to help Jumong defend his kingdom. With the help of the Han army, Jumong and his kingdom are able to repel the attacks of the three Korean kingdoms. However, the Han army is not enough to swing the tide of the war and Jumong is forced to retreat. He decides to make a last stand at the colony he has established on the Japanese archipelago. Jumong and his kingdom make a final stand against the three Korean kingdoms but they are ultimately defeated. Jumong is captured and executed. His kingdom is annexed by the three Korean kingdoms and becomes a part of their empires. END: The story ends with the three Korean kingdoms ruling over the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago. Jumong's legacy is remembered by his people and his kingdom live on through the colonies he established on the Japanese archipelago.
