==========

In 5th century BCE England, a young boy named Arthur is born to a noble family.

Lord Uther is a great warrior, and he raises Arthur to be a strong and courageous knight. When Arthur is grown, he accompanies Lord Uther and his knights on a quest to vanquish a dragon that has been terrorizing the kingdom. They are successful in defeating the dragon, but at the cost of Lord Uther's life. Before he dies, Lord Uther names Arthur as his successor and asks him to protect the kingdom. MIDDLE: Arthur inherits Lord Uther's castle and knights, and he sets out to build a strong army to protect the kingdom. He quickly gaines a reputation as a great warrior and leader, and soon has the largest and most powerful army in the land. He meets a beautiful woman named Guinevere, and they fall in love and marry. Together, they have a son, Mordred. But all is not well in the kingdom. As Mordred gets older, he begins to show signs of being a evil and power-hungry ruler. Arthur realizes that Mordred is a threat to the kingdom, and he prepares for war. In the final battle, Mordred is defeated and killed, but Arthur is mortally wounded. Guinevere mourns him, but knows that he died a hero, fighting for what he believed in. END: Even though Arthur is gone, his legacy continues. His story is told and retold throughout the centuries, inspiring others to be brave and to fight for what is right. He is remembered as a great king and heroic warrior, and his name will live on forever.
