BEGINNING:

==========

In another solar system, there exists a planet that is home to a very special and rare type of creature known as a "siren". These creatures have the ability to lure any creature they encounter with their singing voices, and once they have them under their spell, the sirens can then do whatever they please to their victim. The protagonist of our story is a young woman named Lily, who was born on this planet and has always been fascinated by the sirens. When she was just a little girl, she dreamed of one day becoming a siren herself and using her powers to help others. However, that all changed when Lily's parents were killed by a group of sirens. After witnessing their deaths, Lily swore revenge against all sirens and dedicated her life to hunting them down. Now, many years later, Lily has become a master siren hunter. She's skilled in combat and has a sharp tongue, which she uses to her advantage when dealing with her prey. One day, while Lily is out on a hunt, she comes across a group of sirens who have taken a young man captive. Lily quickly dispatches of the sirens and rescues the man, who introduces himself as Prince Damien. Damien tells Lily that he's been searching for a siren hunter who can help him destroy a powerful siren who has taken over his kingdom. Lily agrees to help Damien and the two of them set off on their quest. During their journey, Lily and Damien begin to develop feelings for each other. However, they both know that they can't act on them, as Damien is betrothed to another woman and Lily is still hell-bent on revenge. Eventually, Lily and Damien reach Damien's kingdom and face off against the siren Queen. After a fierce battle, Lily finally defeats the Queen and frees the kingdom from her tyrannical rule. Now that her revenge is complete, Lily says goodbye to Damien and returns to her life as a siren hunter. However, she knows that she'll always remember the adventure she had with Damien and the special connection they shared.
