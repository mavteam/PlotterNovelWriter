Write a concise summary of the following story.


A human crew is helping an alien planet win a war against their enemy, the Kretons. They are transporting a chemical weapon that will kill all of the Kreton soldiers on the planet without harming any of the aliens. They are attacked by the Kretons, but they manage to escape and reach the planet safely. They are thanked by the aliens for their help and told that it will take several days or weeks to distribute the chemicals throughout the atmosphere.  The human crew is on the ship and they are discussing whether or not they should go back to the planet. They decide to stay on the ship for a few days. The Kretons are coming to attack the ship. The Kretons attack the ship. They kill one of the humans and capture the others. The Kretons take them back to their planet and put them in jail. They interrogate them and try to get information from them about why they were on their planet. The humans refuse to talk and so they are tortured by having their arms cut off over and over again until they talk or die. The human leader is being tortured by having his arms cut off again and again, but he refuses to tell them anything. He tells his crewmates that he will stop at nothing to save them and he will not rest until they are all safe, even if it kills him. He tells them that they should not give up hope because he will escape somehow and save them all before it is too late, even if it kills him. His crewmates tell him that he needs to rest because he is exhausted from all of the torture, but he says that there is no time for rest because there is no telling when his torturers might start cutting off his legs next or something worse. He tells them that he will not give up hope! He says that if anyone else wants to give up hope, then they can do so now, but he will not give up hope! He says that if anyone else wants to die, then they can do so now, but he will never give up hope! His crewmates tell him that if anyone else dies then it won't be his fault because it won't be his fault if someone gives up hope; it will only be their own fault for giving up hope! But he says that if anyone else dies then it won't be because of him; it will only be because of themselves for giving up hope! His crewmates say that even though this whole thing has been hard on everyone, they are glad that at least one person has stayed strong through all of this torture who still has faith in himself and faith in others; who still believes in himself and others; who still believes in humanity; who still believes in humanity's ability to survive against any odds; who still believes in humanity's ability to overcome any obstacle; who still believes in humanity's ability to succeed against impossible odds; who still believes in himself as a human being with a soul made out of steel with a heart made out of iron with blood made out of fire with muscles made out of titanium with skin made out of diamond with bones made out of titanium with nerves made out of titanium with blood vessels made out of titanium with hair made out of steel with fingernails made out of titanium with sweat glands made out of diamond with eyesight sharper than an eagle's eye; whose eyesight can see through walls like Superman's x-ray vision; whose eyesight can see through solid objects like Superman's heat vision; whose eyesight can see through solid objects like Superman's microscopic vision; whose eyesight can see through solid objects like Superman's telescopic vision; whose eyesight can see through solid objects like Superman's microscopic vision from outer space; whose ears hear sounds far below normal human hearing range like bats' hearing range; whose ears hear sounds far above normal human hearing range like dolphins' hearing range; whose ears hear sounds far above normal human hearing range like bats' super-sonic hearing range (bats fly around at night making noises); whose ears hear sounds far below normal human hearing range like dolphins' super-sonic hearing range (dolphins swim around underwater making noises); whose ears hear sounds far above normal human hearing range like bats' ultrasonic hearing range (bats fly around at night making noises); whose ears hear sounds far below normal human hearing range like dolphins' ultrasonic hearing range (dolphins swim around underwater making noises); whose ears hear sounds far above normal human hearing range like bats' ultrasonic echolocation (bats fly around at night making noises); who has more strength than an elephant bull elephant bull elephant bull elephant bull elephant bull elephant bull elephant bull elephant bull elephant bull elephant bull elephant bull elephants bulls elephants bulls elephants bulls elephants bulls elephants bulls elephants bulls elephants bulls elephants bulls elephants bulls elephants bulls elephants bulls elephants bulls elephants bulls elephants bulls elephants cows cows cows cows cows cows cows cows cows cows cows cows cows cow cow cow cow cow cow cow cow cow cattle cattle cattle cattle cattle cattle cattle cattle cattle cattle cattle cattle cattle cattle buffalo buffaloes buffalo buffaloes buffalo buffaloes buffalo buffaloes buffalo buffaloes buffalo buffaloes buffalo buffaloes buffalo buffaloes buffalo buffaloes buffalo buffaloes buffalo buffaloes waterbuffalo waterbuffalo waterbuffalo waterbuffalo waterbuffalo
