As they enter an unknown region of space, the ship is attacked by a horde of aliens. The creatures are unlike anything they have ever seen before and they are quickly overrun. During the course of the battle, Wilder is wounded and taken prisoner by the aliens. He is taken to their home world, where he is experimented on and subjected to unthinkable torture. As he suffers at the hands of his captors, Wilder's mind starts to unravel. He begins to question who he is and what his purpose is. He wonders if he will ever escape and return to his ship and crew.

As he suffers, Wilder starts to have strange visions. He sees his ship and crew, but they are in different places and different times. He sees them fighting and dying, but he does not know if they are real or if they are just products of hisimagination. Wilder's captors become frustrated with him and decide to subject him to a final, brutal experiment. They remove his eyes and insert two strange orbs in their place. These orbs allow Wilder to see into the past, present, and future. He sees all the different paths his life could have taken and all the different ways his ship and crew could have died.
