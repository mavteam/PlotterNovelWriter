==========

In 19th century China, a young woman named Mei is born into a poor family. Despite her humble beginnings, Mei is an incredibly bright and ambitious girl. She excels in her studies and has big dreams of one day becoming a renowned scholar. Unfortunately, Mei's family is unable to afford to send her to school and she is instead married off to a wealthy man twice her age. Mei is heartbroken, but she dutifully takes on her new role as wife and mother. Despite her unhappiness, Mei is determined to make the best of her situation. She throws herself into her domestic duties and finds joy in raising her young son. Slowly but surely, Mei begins to win over her husband's affections. He starts to see her as more than just a traditional wife and treats her with respect and kindness. Eventually, Mei's husband dies and she is left a widowed woman with a young child. MIDDLE: Despite her newfound freedom, Mei does not remarry. She instead dedicates her life to her son, raising him to be a kind and successful man. As he grows older, Mei's son begins to express interest in the world beyond their small village.

Mei is sad to see him go, but she is also proud of his courage and ambition. With her son gone, Mei once again feels loneliness and isolation. However, she takes comfort in knowing that he is chasing his dreams and making a better life for himself. END: A few years later, Mei receives a letter from her son informing her that he has met a wonderful woman and they are to be married. He asks Mei to come and live with them in the city, and she happily agrees. Mei's son's wife is a lovely woman, and the two of them soon have a child of their own. Mei is thrilled to be a grandmother and finally feels like she has found her true home. Although she is now quite old, Mei continues to be an active member of her family and community.
