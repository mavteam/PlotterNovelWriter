SCENE 2: Captain Wilder and Commander Krieg are standing in front of a podium. Captain Wilder is speaking to the crowd about their mission.

SCENE 3: Captain Wilder and Commander Krieg are walking down a hallway. They hear a voice behind them. It is Ensign Jeffrey, who is telling them that there is an emergency in the engine room.

SCENE 4: Captain Wilder, Commander Krieg and Ensign Jeffrey are standing over a table looking at a diagram of the engine room. There is an explosion in the engine room, setting off alarms all over the ship. The three run out of the room and down the hallway to see what happened.
