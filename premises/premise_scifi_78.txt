20xx. Humanity has left Earth behind, putting all their eggs in one baskets and colonizing Mars. They've terraformed the red planet and made it their new home, but it's not enough. They want to explore, to expand their reach even further. So they build a giant space station, the ISS Enterprise, and send it out into the unknown. The Enterprise is crewed by the best and the brightest of humanity. But when they stumble upon an alien species, the Malakim, they realize that they're not alone in the universe. The Malakim are a warlike people, and they want the Enterprise for themselves. The crew of the Enterprise must find a way to warn Earth of the impending invasion, and stop the Malakim before they can reach Mars. But they'll have to fight tooth and nail to do it. It'll be the fight of their lives.
