Henrik is a young man who discovers he has the ability to transform into a dragon. When his village is attacked by a horde of demons, Henrik leads the charge to defend his home, using his dragon form to incinerate the demons. The townspeople hail him as a hero, and he eventually becomes their king. Henrik's wife, Queen Elise, also has dragon blood, and she gives birth to twin dragon-human children. The four of them live happily together until the day a group of humans arrives, seeking to kill all dragons. Henrik and Elise are forced to choose between fighting back or surrendering themselves to the humans. They ultimately decide to fight, and they triumph against the humans. In the aftermath, Henrik and Elise realize that they can no longer stay in the village and must leave to protect their children. They leave with heavy hearts, but they know they will find a new home where they can be together and live safely as dragons.
