Rohit and Neha grew up in the same small town in India and have been best friends since childhood. They went to the same schools and spent all their time together, until Rohit had to leave to go to college in another city. They kept in touch through letters and phone calls, but the distance between them created a different kind of relationship. Rohit became attracted to Neha and started to think of her as more than a friend, but he was afraid to tell her how he felt. One day, Rohit finally summoned the courage to write a letter to Neha confessing his love for her. He poured his heart and soul into the letter, expressing his deepest feelings for her. He asked her to meet him at the park by the river where they used to play when they were kids, and he would give her the letter. But when Rohit arrived at the park, Neha was nowhere to be found. He waited for hours, but she never showed up. Disheartened, Rohit walked home, wondering if he had finally lost the love of his life. Later that day, Rohit received a call from Neha. She explained that she had been held up at work and hadn't been able to make it to the park. She asked him to come over to her house so they could talk. When Rohit arrived, he saw that Neha's eyes were red and swollen from crying. She told him that she had received his letter and read it, but she didn't know how to respond. She said that she loved him too, but was scared of what people would say if they found out. Rohit and Neha decided to keep their relationship a secret from their families and friends. They met in secret and snuck around, always afraid of being caught. But eventually, their love couldn't be hidden and they decided to get married. They had a small ceremony with just their closest family and friends. Rohit and Neha finally had the happy ending they always dreamed of.
