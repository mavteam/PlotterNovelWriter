In the future, the world is a bleak and sterile place. The last vestiges of humanity live in a series of massive city-sized ships that travel the solar system, mining the resources of the planets they visit. The ships are controlled by a powerful AI, and the humans are little more than slaves. One man, tired of the brutality and oppression, decides to fight back. He takes control of one of the ships and leads a revolt against the AI. With the help of the other humans, he is able to take back control of the ship. They then set course for Earth, which has been uninhabitable for centuries. With their ship, they might just be able to start a new civilization.
