Samantha is a scientist working on a new project to study the effect of space travel on the human body. She and her team are testing a new device that will allow them to travel to different parts of the universe without having to leave their spaceship. They are also testing a new type of fuel that will allow them to travel faster than the speed of light. When they are ready to test the new device, they launch their spaceship and travel to a nearby planet. There they find a strange creature that is lurking in the shadows. The creature is about to attack them when Samantha's team uses the new device to travel back to their own planet. They are safe, but they are not sure what the creature was or where it came from.
