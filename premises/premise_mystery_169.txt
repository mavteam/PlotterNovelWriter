The town librarian, Peggy, is sorting through some old books that were donated to the library when she comes across a dusty old journal. Intrigued, she starts reading it and quickly becomes engrossed in the story of a young woman who lived in the town over a hundred years ago. As Peggy reads the journal, she realizes that the woman was murdered, and that the killer was never caught. She becomes determined to solve the case and bring the killer to justice. She enlists the help of her best friend, Jenny, and together they start digging into the cold case. They interview people who are descendants of the people who lived in the town at the time of the murder, and they uncover some new leads. Slowly but surely, they piece together the puzzle and finally catch the killer.
