When the sun begins to die, humanity is faced with its own extinction. In a last-ditch effort to save the species, a team of scientists build a starship and set out in search of a new home. But the journey is fraught with danger, and not everyone on the ship is willing to put the survival of the human race above their own personal desires. As the ship hurtles through space, the crew must grapple with their own humanity – and their own mortality – in order to find a new home before it's too late.
