When the last king of the realm was slain in battle, all hope seemed lost. But Prince Aidan, heir to the throne, was not ready to give up. He rallied the remaining forces of the kingdom and led them on a desperate charge against the enemy. Though they were outnumbered and outmatched, they fought with the ferocity of those who had nothing left to lose. In a hail of blood and steel, they destroyed the enemy's army and won the day. But the cost was high. Aidan's beloved wife was killed in the fighting, and his best friend was mortally wounded. As he mourning their loss, he was approached by a dark stranger who offered him a deal. In exchange for the souls of his fallen comrades, the stranger would grant him the power to exact revenge on those who had destroyed his kingdom. Aidan hesitated for only a moment before agreeing. He knew that there was no other way to save his friend's soul and that he would have his revenge. And so he struck a bargain with the devil. Now, armed with dark magic and a blade that thirsts for blood, Aidan will stop at nothing to destroy those whouries... And so the cycle of violence begins anew.
