Sevrin, a young rogue, has been on the run from the law since he was a boy. When his mother dies, he has nothing left to live for and decides to end it all. He finds himself in a small village, on the edge of the woods. The village is being terrorized by a creature that comes out at night, killing anything that moves. Sevrin knows that he can't let the creature continue to kill, so he decides to take it down himself. He sets a trap for the creature, but it doesn't work and he's killed. As he dies, he sees the creature for what it really is: a young girl who is lost and confused.
