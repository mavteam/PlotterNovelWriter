A team of scientists are working on a new project to terraform Mars. They have developed a new technology that will allow them to create a artificial atmosphere on the planet. The team is also working on a way to create a viable ecosystem for the new planet. The team's work is cut short when another team of scientists, working on a similar project, arrives on Mars. The two teams begin to compete for resources and information. The competition eventually leads to violence, and the two teams are forced to coexist on the hostile planet. The teams must find a way to work together in order to survive on Mars. They also have to find a way to terraform the planet and make it habitable for humans.
