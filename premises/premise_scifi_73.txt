In the future, the human race has colonized Mars and established a thriving society. However, when a massive global war breaks out on Earth, the Martian colonists are cut off from their home planet and left to fend for themselves. As the years go by, the Martians slowly begin to lose touch with their humanity. They become a war-like people, constantly fighting amongst themselves for resources. One day, a group of Martian soldiers stumble upon a capsule that had been sent from Earth years before. Inside is a woman who is in stasis. The woman is thawed and revived, and she tells the Martians about the war that ravaged Earth. She also tells them of the hope that the human race still has for a future. The Martians are inspired by the woman's words, and they set out to build a new society on Mars, one that is based on peace and cooperation.
