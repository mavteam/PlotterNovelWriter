The town is in shock and everyone is a suspect. Enter Daisy Goodwin, a young woman who has just moved to Willowbrook to start her own bakery. Daisy is determined to solve the murder, and with the help of her quirky best friend, Suzy, she just might be able to do it. With a cast of colorful characters and a few lucky breaks, Daisy sets out to find the killer before they strike again. Along the way, she discovers that not everything is as perfect as it seems in Willowbrook, and that some secrets are best left buried.
