In the future, scientists have developed a way to travel through time. However, there is a catch – only objects made of certain materials can be sent through time. When the scientists test the machine out on a small metal object, it works perfectly. But when they try to send a human through, the machine malfunction and the person is killed. The scientists are devastated and decide to destroy the machine. But before they can, a group of criminals find out about the machine and kidnap one of the scientists, forcing him to send them back in time so they can commit a major heist. The scientist is able to send the criminals back, but they land in the middle of a war zone and are immediatley captured by the enemy.

The criminals are finally able to escape the time machine and make it back to the present. But the scientist is killed in the process. The machine is destroyed and the criminals are arrested. But the events that transpired have changed the future – and not for the better.
