When Hannah sets out on a cross-country road trip with her best friend to escape her broken home life, she never expects to fall in love. But when they meet Ian, a handsome and carefree drifter, Hannah can't help but be drawn in. Against her better judgment, she allows herself to fall for him, and the two embark on a passionate affair.

But as the miles stretch on and their time together runs out, Hannah starts to realize that Ian is hiding something. He's evasive about his past and seems to be running from something himself. She starts to wonder if their relationship is built on anything more than a shared sense of wanderlust.

Just when she's ready to give up on him, Ian finally opens up about his past and the pain he's been running from. He confesses that he's been afraid to get close to anyone because he doesn't want to hurt them like he's been hurt before. But with Hannah, he feels safe and loved.

The two finally admit their feelings for each other and agree to stay together, despite the distance between them. They promise to find a way to make it work, no matter what. And they'll start by writing to each other every day, until they can find a way to be in each other's arms again.
