After a long day of work, Peggy Sue is looking forward to her cozy evening at home with her cat, Mr. Noodles. She sets out a bowl of food for him and settles in with her latest knitting project. However, when she goes to take a sip of tea, she realizes that her cup is empty. She gets up to refill it, and when she comes back, she finds Mr. Noodles with his paw in the bowl of food, looking guilty. Peggy Sue knows that her cat would never steal food, so she starts to investigate. She begins by questioning her neighbors. Did anyone see anything suspicious earlier in the day? She didn't notice anything when she came home from work, but she was in a rush to get her knitting project started. She talks to the neighbors on either side of her and the ones across the street, but no one saw anything. She is about to give up when she remembers the new family that moved in a few houses down. She goes to talk to them, and they tell her that they saw a black cat sneaking around Peggy Sue's house earlier in the day. Now that she has a suspect, Peggy Sue sets a trap. She puts a dish of food in the middle of her living room and waits. Sure enough, the black cat comes slinking in. Peggy Sue grabs him and takes him to the pound. The next day, she gets a call from the pound. They tell her that the cat is actually a Maine Coon and he belongs to the family down the street. They must have let him out when they moved in and he's been living in the neighborhood ever since. Peggy Sue is relieved that her mystery is solved and Mr. Noodles is innocent. She's also glad to have made some new friends in the neighborhood.
