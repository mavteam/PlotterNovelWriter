The Hazens are a family of space pirates who have been terrorizing the galaxy for generations. When the youngest Hazard, John, is born, his father, the captain of the Hazard ship, dies in a space battle. John's mother is killed shortly thereafter by a rival pirate crew. John is raised by his grandparents and taught the ways of the Hazards. When John is 18, his grandfather dies and John inherits the Hazard ship. John leads the Hazards on a series of raids and battles, gradually gaining a reputation as the most fearsome space pirate in the galaxy. One day, John's ship is attacked by a rival pirate crew, led by the notorious pirate queen, Blackheart. John is captured and taken to Blackheart's ship. Blackheart offers John a choice: join her crew and serve her, or be executed. John refuses and is thrown into the ship's brig. John spends the next year plotting his escape and planning his revenge against Blackheart. Finally, John makes his move. He overpowers the guard in his cell, takes Blackheart hostage, and hijacks her ship. John leads the Hazards on a new reign of terror, and Blackheart is never seen again.
