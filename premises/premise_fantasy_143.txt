She quickly discovers that they're far more nefarious than she could have imagined, and that they have dark magic at their disposal. With the help of some unlikely allies, she rallies the village to fight back and ultimately defeats the bandits. However, the cost is high, and the village is left in ruins. The young woman is hailed as a hero, but she can't help but feel broken and lost, having lost everything she once held dear.
