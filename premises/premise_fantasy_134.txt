Deep in the forest, beyond the reach of civilization, there is a small town called Shea. For generations, the people of Shea have lived in peace, living off the land and trading with the nearby villages. But all of that is about to change. One night, a caravan arrives in town, bringing with it a strange man who calls himself a wizard. He has dark power and soon takes control of the town, enslaving the people and using them for his own dark purposes. The people of Shea must find a way to free themselves from the wizard's control and save their town before it's too late.
