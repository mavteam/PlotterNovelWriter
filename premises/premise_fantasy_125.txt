They have been terrorizing the countryside, pillaging villages and leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. Lysanthir knows that he cannot take them on alone and must find help. He finally comes across a group of dwarves who are also tracking the orcs. They agree to help Lysanthir and they set off together. After days of hard travel, they finally catch up to the orcs. They launch a surprise attack and are able to defeat them. Lysanthir and the dwarves return to the nearest town to warn them of the danger and to help them rebuild.
