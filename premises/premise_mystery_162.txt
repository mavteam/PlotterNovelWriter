After the success of her first novel, Emily Charmichael decides to take a break from writing and moves to the small town of Shepherdstown to open a bookstore. One day, while she's working in the store, a customer comes in and asks her to help solve a mystery. The customers's name is Abbey, and she's convinced that her husband, who died in a car accident, is still alive. Abbey is sure that he was the victim of a murder plot, and she wants Emily to help her find the killers. Emily is hesitant at first, but she decides to help Abbey after she learns that the police are not taking Abbey's claim seriously. She begins by talking to Abbey's husband's friends and family, and she quickly realizes that there are a lot of people who had motives to kill him. As she starts to piece together the puzzle, she becomes more and more convinced that Abbey is right, and that her husband's death was not an accident. But just as she's about to uncover the truth, the killer strikes again, and Emily finds herself in grave danger.
