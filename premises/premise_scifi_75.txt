The year is 2755. The human race has been decimated by a pandemic that has swept across the globe, killing billions. The few survivors have retreated to underground colonies, where they struggle to survive. Life in the colonies is hard. The air is stale, the water is filthy, and the food is rationed. The only thing that keeps the colonists going is the hope that one day they will be able to return to the surface. One colonist, a scientist named Dr. Sarah James, is working on a way to purge the pandemic from the human race. Her work is difficult, and she often feels like she is making no progress. But one day, she makes a breakthrough. She develops a cure for the pandemic. Now, the challenge is to get the cure to the surface, where it can be disseminated to the remaining human colonies. But the journey is fraught with danger, and not everyone is willing to risk their lives for the greater good. Can Sarah and her team make it to the surface with the cure? And if they do, will they be able to save the human race?
