The human race has reached a point where we have exhausted all of Earth's resources. In a last ditch effort to save our species, we have sent a colonization mission to a habitable planet in a nearby solar system. The mission consists of a large mother ship containing all the resources needed to start a new civilization, and a smaller exploratory vessel contain a team of scientists and soldiers. The journey is long and fraught with danger, but the colonist eventually reach their destination. They find a world that is teeming with strange and exotic life, and begin the process of terraforming the planet to make it habitable for humans. However, they are not the only ones interested in this new world. The exploration team quickly discovers that they are not alone on this planet. They are soon met by a hostile alien race who are also vying for control of the planet. A war breaks out between the two factions, and the humans find themselves vastly outnumbered and outgunned. As the battle rages on, the human colonies are slowly being overrun. The mother ship is destroyed, and the exploration team is forced to retreat into the wilds of the planet. They must now find a way to warn the other humans of the impending danger, and help them prepare for the final battle that will determine the fate of the human race.
