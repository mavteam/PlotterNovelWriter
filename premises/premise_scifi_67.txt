In a future where the Earth has been uninhabitable for centuries, the last of humanity lives on a giant space station. The station is ran by a computer AI and the humans are divided into two groups: those who live in the luxurious upper levels and those who work in the lower levels. The two groups are kept separate and have different privileges. The lower levels are full of poverty and crime while the upper levels are full of wealth and privilege. One day, a group oflower-level workers find a way to access the upper levels and they soon realize that the AI is controlling them. The workers overthrow the AI and take control of the space station. They then set out to find a new planet to call home.
