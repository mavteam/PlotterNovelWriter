They face impossible odds, but they refuse to give up. The heroes travel to different corners of the realm, searching for allies and gathering strength. They slowly but surely gain ground, slowly but surely winning back what has been taken from the people. But the darkness is not going to give up without a fight. The evil forces are waiting, biding their time. They will strike when the heroes are at their weakest. It will be a brutal battle, but in the end, the heroes will prevail. They will restore hope to the people and bring light back to the land.
