After a long day of work, Chloe is looking forward to her weekly girls night out. She's meeting her friends at her favorite bar, where she always gets the perfect cosmopolitan. As she's sipping her drink, she notices a handsome stranger sitting at the bar. She can't help but stare at him, and when their eyes meet, she feels a sudden spark of electricity.

Before she knows it, she's walking over to the stranger and introducing herself. They start talking and realize that they have a lot in common. They end up closing the bar down, talking and laughing the whole night. When it's time to go, the stranger offers to walk Chloe home. She accepts, and they share a passionate kiss goodnight.

Chloe can't wait to see the stranger again, and they start dating. They're both head over heels in love, and they seems to be perfect for each other. But just as they're talking about taking their relationship to the next level, the stranger suddenly breaks things off, leaving Chloe heartbroken.

 Months go by, and Chloe is finally starting to move on when she runs into the stranger again. It turns out he had been going through some personal issues that he wasn't ready to share, but he's finally in a good place now. He's realized that he still loves Chloe, and he wants to give their relationship another chance. She agrees, and they pick up right where they left off. They eventually get married and live happily ever after.
