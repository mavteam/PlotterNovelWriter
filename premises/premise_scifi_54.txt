In the future, the human race has been all but wiped out by a race of advanced aliens. The few remaining humans are scattered in small colonies across the galaxy. One of these colonies is a small planet on the outskirts of the galaxy. The colony is home to a group of scientists who are working on a project to create a new form of energy. The project is top secret and the scientists are the only ones who know about it. One day, one of the scientists, a woman named Karen, discovers that the project is a fraud. The energy they are creating is not new, and it is not safe. Karen is horrified and decides to go public with her findings. She is immediately arrested and put on trial. The other scientists are forced to testify against her, and she is found guilty. She is sentenced to death. Karen is sent to a prison planet where she meets a group of other humans who are also sentenced to death. They are all given a chance to compete in a series of challenges, with the winner being given the chance to go free. Karen decides to compete, and she quickly realizes that she is the only one who can win. With the help of her new friends, she makes it through the challenges and is freed. Karen and her friends return to the colony and expose the project. The other scientists are arrested and the project is shut down. Karen is hailed as a hero, and she realizes that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope.
