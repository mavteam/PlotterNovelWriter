Byren loved his two older brothers, but he always felt like the odd one out. The black sheep of the family. While his brothers were both strong and handsome, Byren was small and scrawny. He was always getting picked on by the other kids in town. Even his own brothers liked to pick on him. One day, while Byren was out in the woods playing by himself, he found a strange looking stone. It was shining and pulsing with a weird light. Byren felt drawn to it and picked it up. Suddenly, he was hit with a vision. He saw himself leading an army of brave warriors into battle. He saw himself slaying a dragon. He saw himself crowned king. The vision was so real and so detailed that Byren was shaken to his core. He knew that it was a sign. A sign that he was destined for great things. Things that he could never even imagine. From that day on, Byren was a changed man. He trained hard, determined to become the warrior he saw in his vision. He wanted to make his family proud. And one day, he would be the king of his people.
