When peasants in the small town of Pemberton begin disappearing in the middle of the night, the town guard is baffled. Months go by with no explanation and the disappearances show no sign of slowing. Desperate for answers, the town guard seeks the help of a group of traveling adventurers. The adventurers begin their investigation by questioning the townspeople. They soon discover that most of the missing people had one thing in common: they were all deeply religious. The adventurers also find that the disappearances seem to be centered around the local temple. While investigating the temple, the adventurers are attacked by a group of cultists. After a fierce battle, the cultists are defeated and the adventurers find a secret passage leading into the temple basement. In the basement, the adventurers find a horrific scene: the missing townspeople have been captured and are being used as sacrifices in a dark ritual. The cultists are trying to summon a powerful demon into the world. The adventurers interrupt the ritual and battle the demon. In the end, they are victorious and the demon is banished back to its own realm. The townspeople are freed and the town of Pemberton is saved.
